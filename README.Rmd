# Overview 

The System Wide Monitoring Program ([SWMP](http://nerrs.noaa.gov/RCDefault.aspx?ID=18)) was implemented by the National Estuarine Research Reserve System ([NERRS](http://nerrs.noaa.gov/)) in 1995 to provide continuous monitoring data at over 140 continuous monitoring stations in 28 estuaries across the United States.  SWMPrExtension (pronounce "swamper extension") is an R package that provides additional functions to organize and analyze SWMP data and is intended as a companion package for [SWMPr](https://github.com/fawda123/SWMPr) (pronounced "swamper"). Currently, there is no citation for SWMPrExtension.

[SWMPr](https://github.com/fawda123/SWMPr) is an R package for retrieving, organizing, and analyzing estuary monitoring data from SWMP.SWMPr can be cited as follows:
